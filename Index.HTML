<p> Hello I am Giovanni Lazala. I am making this website today to talk about College. Personally I hate it and everything it gives and takes. College is a great place to meet new people from different paths of life and people simillar to you. Apparently thats not the case for me because everyone I know finds me unique. Some would want to be unique but not me. Whatever makes me unique has only hindered me and has kept me as an outcast in every social group I am a part of. This sucks but others see it as a gift when they first meet me and really enjoy meeting me like its a breath of fresh air. As time passes no matter who I meet they always end up not liking me and its never for a specific reason other then the fact that I am different from everyone in their eyes. This has never been more prevelant to me until I came to college and it hurts more then it ever has before. I honestly hate it here and everything about it because I cant seem to find a single person that shares anything in common with me other then some hobbies. I will keep pushing forward hoping for something but at the moment all I see in front of me is a cliff that has a never ending drop into the unkown.
<h2> Here is something I like to imagine that helps </h2>
